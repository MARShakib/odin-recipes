    <h3>This hearty Guinness beef stew recipe is perfect for cozy days at home.</h3>
    <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.</li>
        <li>Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>This chunky Guinness stew features onions, carrots, and celery.</li>
        <li>Tomato paste adds richness and flavor depth.</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon. Transfer the bacon to a stew pot, but leave the fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef cubes in the fat. Place the browned beef in the stew pot.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions and garlic in the fat. Pour the beer in and stir.</li>
        <li>Simmer until the meat is tender, then bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Serve in bowls or over mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
