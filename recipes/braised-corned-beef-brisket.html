   <h3>It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year round.</h3>
   <p>Corned beef is a beef brisket (a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest) that has been cured in a salt solution. "Corning" results in intensely flavorful, super tender meat. In this recipe, the corned beef brisket is seared in a hot skillet and then braised all day with garlic and onions for a melt-in-your-mouth texture and perfect flavor.</p>
   <p>Recipe creator mauigirl serves this corned beef brisket with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips for a complete Irish-inspired feast.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen Bouquet), or as desired</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps:</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until meat is tender, about 6 hours.</li>
